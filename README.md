WhisApp: Whisper Your Journeys

Category: Travel & Exploration

WhisApp is a personalized travel companion app that lets users log their travel experiences via audio, share secret local tips, and discover hidden gems while exploring the world. With an emphasis on authentic audio storytelling, WhisApp bridges the gap between travel journaling and social exploration.

Concept

WhisApp is designed to be more than a travel log—it’s an interactive, community-driven platform where every voice matters. Travelers record their experiences, thoughts, and memories in audio form while discovering off-the-beaten-path recommendations (or “whispers”) from fellow explorers and locals.
